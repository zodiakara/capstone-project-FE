ECO-swAPP ...'insert name here'!!

declutter your house and free yourself by joining the community of like-minded people!
ecology is the new hot trend and with that in mind i've decided to create an app that is gonna teach
people about ecology and also offer a platform for exchanging stuff that is no longer needed in your household.
you've got a piece of furniture that is no longer serving you but is still in a good shape ?
create a profile on ... app and add it. maybe your neighbour could make a use out of it ?
or if it's completely broken read our ecology guide and learn how to dispose it with the least impact on the environment

**we teach about good practices 
we preach circular economy approach
we offer a great community of eco-aware people who share the same goal: SUSTAINABILITY**
